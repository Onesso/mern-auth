in creating the server we run a 'npm i express' in the root folder so that the front-end can run on the backend; here the express runs once.
'npm i nodemon' this makes the express to be always running.

under package.json script is changed to  
 "scripts": {
    "dev": "nodemon api/index.js",
    "start": "node api/index.js"
  },

  therefore the server will be always active and listing to port

'npm i mongoose' must be run in the root project to install mongoose in our application.
sign up into mangodb and create a project
connect to the database using the driver
copy the connection string and add it into the code (index.js) that was created under the api folder
a .env file is created in the root for sucurity purpose while sharing the code, in this file a variable is created MONGO and the connection string is stored there, the MONGO is later passsed in the index.js 
'npm i dotenv' this package is installed to enable the .env to work
